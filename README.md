<b>Shibo</b> is a 7 y/o boy who is terrified of injections & medicines. One day, he read in his textbook:

> __An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.__

He thus, obtained the _magic formula_ to prevent visits to doctors and bear the unpleasant taste of medicines. He could imagine a life free of the agony of needles. <br><br>
He went to his orchard the next day to get some apples. But...:worried: he's not very good at collecting falling apples _(of course, he's only 7)_.<br><br>
__Can YOU help little Shibo in collecting the apples?__ <br>
I knew you would agree!:wink: Keep an eye out for worms. __Each worm destroys one apple!__ <br><br>
Assist Shibo in collecting as many apples as possible so that he can proudly proclaim __"I AM HEALTHY SHIBO!"__<br>

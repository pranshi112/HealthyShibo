<b>Shibo</b> is a 7 y/o boy who is very afraid of injections & medicines. One day, he read in his textbook:

> __An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.__

He thus, got the _magic formula_ to prevent visiting doctors and bear that unplesant taste of medicines. He could imagine a life free from the pain of the needles. <br><br>
Next day, he went to his orchard to get some apples. But...:worried: he isn't good at catching falling apples _(of course, he's just 7)_.<br><br>
__Can YOU help little Shibo to catch the apples?__ <br>
I know you would agree!:wink: Make sure to avoid worms while catching apples. __Each worm destroys one apple!__ <br><br>
Help Shibo collect maximum apples so that he can proudly say __"I AM HEALTHY SHIBO!"__<br>

__Note__: The controls are mapped onto arrow keys and A,D keys.<br><br>
